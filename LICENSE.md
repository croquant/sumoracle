### _As was scribed in the annals of our craft, in the Year of Our Code, let it be known:_

**In the Name of the Maintainer, the Contributors, and the Holy Assembly of Code**,  
this writ conveyeth the following decrees unto all who dare make use of this sacred Work, henceforth named _The Software_.

## Grant of Use

Hearken, O ye scribes and builders of digital marvels!  
Permission is hereby granted, freely and without tithe, to any soul who possesseth this script, to deal therein without levy or tribute, in the manner of use, replication, transcription, and conveyance, be it in whole or in broken part.

> “He hath made the earth by His power, He hath established the world by His wisdom.”  
> — _Jeremiah 10:12_

Thus mayest thou use The Software for purpose noble or profane, provided that all who receive it knoweth from whence it came.

## Conditions of Righteous Attribution

Thou shalt:

1. **Keep the Inscription:** The name of the authors, as etched in the scrolls, must not be effaced, neither in the code nor in its parchment of documentation.
2. **Declare the Heirs:** Any re-distribution, whether cloaked or open, must bear the selfsame script of license as this, unabridged and unadulterated.
3. **Speak Not False Testimony:** The names of the original artisans shall not be used to sell or sanctify modified versions, save with written leave.

> “Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.”  
> — _Proverbs 22:28_

Let none lift their horn in pride, claiming the labors of others as their own.

## Covenant of Limitation

Let it be written, and let it be done:

This Work is delivered _as is_, without warrant of merchantability or fitness, be it for the mundane or the divine. In no wise shall the Makers or Bearers of the Software be liable for any wrath, plague, misfortune, or data corruption that may befall thee through its usage.

> “The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the Lord.”  
> — _Proverbs 21:31_

Therefore, proceed in humility, and test thy tools as a wise steward.

## Benediction and Warning

Go forth, children of the circuit and cipher. Work wonders, but do so with honor and remembrance.  
For as it is whispered in the apocrypha of Enoch:

> “The secrets of the heavens were revealed unto the sons of man, but woe unto those who transgress the boundary stones.”

Thus ends the writ.

**So let it be committed to the scrolls, under seal of the Maintainers.**  
Amen.
